# Earthquake Visualization

## Overview

This assignment involves visualizing earthquake data using the USGS GeoJSON Feed. The goal is to create an interactive map that plots earthquakes based on their magnitude, depth, and location.

## Create the Earthquake Visualization

### Steps
#### Get your dataset:
* Visit the USGS GeoJSON Feed page.
* Choose a dataset (e.g., "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days") and click on it to get the JSON representation of the data.

#### Import and visualize the data:
* Use Leaflet to create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
* Size the data markers to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake and color them based on the depth of the earthquake.
* Include popups that provide additional information about each earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

#### Create a legend:
* Create a legend that explains the magnitude and depth ranges represented by the marker sizes and colors.
Create a legend that explains the magnitude and depth ranges represented by the marker sizes and colors.
